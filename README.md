# PythonProjects

This repository is collection of python projects which I personally want to back up. 
although all folders are not organized, most of them are projects from ICS33 (3rd of three leveled python course in UCI)
solutions are mostly passed as 100% of test cases. (98% in worst).
I personally understand every solutions, logics, skills and syntax.

lecture was from professor Richard Pattis.
